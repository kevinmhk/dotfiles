# Subtask Quality Bar

Use this checklist before finalizing expanded action items.

- Each subtask starts with a strong verb and has one clear outcome.
- Each subtask is independently actionable without hidden context.
- Dependencies are explicit when task order matters.
- Acceptance criteria are measurable and not subjective.
- Handoff notes include concrete file paths, commands, or artifacts.
- Scope is preserved from the source plan unless assumptions are documented.
- Open risks and missing prerequisites are surfaced explicitly.
